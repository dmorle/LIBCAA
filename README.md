# LIBCAA

C++ library for Computer Aided Analysis.
This library was started initially for ELEC 2110 (CAA) at the university of windsor.

The goal of this library is to offer a layer of abstraction for computer aided analysis problems,
simplifying problems and optimizing backend functions through parellel computing.
